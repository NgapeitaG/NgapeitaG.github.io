<h1>At Whitecliffe, I faced many challenges to completing my projects. I had to possess good time management skills, a lot of money, hard work and produce high standards of work. The projects can be described as tedious and the briefs were written in advanced language which you would have to decypher.For a beginner like myself, the standards expected of me were out of my league and I often felt lost with some of my projects at Whitecliffe. Out of the three years that I studied there, I will admit that it taught me to work hard and I thrived on that challenge.I picked up many skills and grew to love the projects. Although it was difficult at times with my work, I don't regret gaining an education in graphic design which will be helpful with my learning journey at Dev academy.</h1>
