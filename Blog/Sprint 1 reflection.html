My Reflections - Sprint One

<h2>In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain english? Can you think of an analogy for it?</h2>
<h1>The command line is where you type commands to control the content on your computer. You can add, delete, move, copy, rename files and directories on your computer. It is essential that you use the commands for their specific purpose and don't mistype or remove files straight away as you cannot retrieve those files or folders once they are removed. Once something is removed, it will be gone forever</h1>

<h2>Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</h2>
<h1>I went way over the time box and focused on one area for more than 2 hours. The time box suggested 20 minutes but I didn't read the time box properly.To change this, I will write down the times on a whiteboard which I have above my desk, so that I can remember when I see the visual note. I watched a very long tutorial on youtube about command lines in your terminal and forgot the time limit stated in the time box.</h1>

<h2>Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.</h2>
<ul><li>Cd - this is to go to a specific directory</li>
<li>Ls - this lists the files or directories under a directory</li>
<li>Rm - this removes files</li>
<li>Pwd - Tells me where exactly I am in the file system</li>
<li>History - this tells me the history of everything I've typed onto the command line of the terminal</li></ul>
Did you learn anything unexpected?
All the commands which I've learnt today including the five commands listed above really opened my eyes to the commands that go into a computers file system. I've never known any of these commands until today and it's been a nice learning experience. I have been picking things up quickly.

Next section of Reflection - Sprint 1

Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is the actual version control software. This is the actual application which you run on your laptop. Github however is a website where you can sign up to an account and do git things on a server/website. 2. Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

An analogy to describe them are that they are a system you can use to keep track of the history of a project as well as allow many people to collaborate on a project together. 3. Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

Yes, I stuck to the time box suggestions and got the tasks done earlier. 4. Any surprises or anything you'd like to share (e.g. Super useful resources)

The best video which quickly gave me the definitions for what Git and Github were in a simplified definition was this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY. I also learnt that version control is a software which saves different versions of your projects. This is what Git and git hub are.

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face? The only issues which I found when working in this strategy was sticking to the timebox times.
Did you learn any new skills or tricks? I've learn five new commands on the terminal which are ls, mkdir, rm, pwd and history.
How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies? I feel unconfident in my work when I mess up on something, study longer than the timebox or don't understand a challenge.
Which parts of the work did you enjoy? I enjoyed learning the commands and giving the command line prompts a try.
Which parts of the work did you find tedious? The parts which I found most tedious for this section was the exploration section but overall the entire work was pretty relaxed. It wasn;t difficult to follow.
Install and explore Git - Reflection

On the same text document as your last reflection, answer these questions:

What is a GitHub work flow? It is the process a file takes in order to be committed to a repository. The file starts in the working directory, it is then staged into the staging index, then it is committed into the repository. What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked? I went online to find the answers, I went back to the question to decode it or I went on slack to ask for solutions from my classmates. Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again? I wouldn't change anything.

Track Changes - Reflection

How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend? Staging is when you submit a file before you're about to change it and save it as a new version. It's the step you do to a file once everything has been changed, you move it to the staging area and then the changes are ready to be saved and recorded for your file.

Committing is where you submit a file so that you can record the changes that have been made to that file. Once you commit your file, it will have a special set of numbers and letters called a SHA which is a fancy ID to categorise your changes you made to your file. When you commit a file, you're putting on record the actual changes you made to your file you're committing to the git gods.

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face? The problems which I faced were not many. The configuration took a little while and I eventually figured out how to properly configure it with github.
Did you learn any new skills or tricks? Only how to properly configure my terminal with git.
How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies? This learning competency felt long and tedious to learn but I feel somewhat confident.
Which parts of the work did you enjoy? I enjoyed the configuration once it was completed.
Which parts of the work did you find tedious? The try it out section for this strategy took 4 hours long. I had to watch Lesson 1 - Lesson 4 of the Udacity git & git flow tutorials. This felt tedious as I watched the tutorials over a two day period.
Branch, Pull, Merge Primer - Reflection

What is Master?
A master is basically the main branch that stays unchanged. It is where the original project comes from. You have to create another branch off the master so that you can add your own changes, create a pull request to where it has to be accepted by the owner of the project. This will fast forward the master branch. 2. Why create a Branch?

Branches enable you to make your own changes in a project, but it also keeps the main master branch from questionable code. A branch creates a seperate branch for you to add changes to a project. 3. Did anything surprise you?

What surprised me was how much I have learnt so far. The learning experience has been rocky but I always get clarification and support from fellow classmates if I'm a bit cloudy on info, or unsure.

Fork and Clone - Reflection

What are some examples of when you would fork?
Write your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions. Describe what you did.
Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
Stage your file.
Answers

A few examples of when you would fork work is when you want to use another persons project as a starting point for your own but you want to make changes to the project which you copied/forked from another persons project without affecting theirs. Another example would be to fork a project which has important information to your own repository's so that you can read the text within that forked file.

Fork instructions:

Go to the origin or the repo on github which you would like to fork.
In the top right hand corner, click fork and select where you want the repo to be copied to. I fork repo's into my user page.
The forked repo will automatically be opened and you will be in the forked repo
I then had to find the settings button and enable issues. Clone instructions:
Go to the repo you want to clone
Click the clone button on the top right hand corner of the repo & copy the link
Go to your terminal and type git clone + spacebar to put a space.
Press command + V so that the computer pastes that web url that we cloned earlier for your chosen repo, that you want to clone.
So you will have git clone https://github.com/your username/foundations
The terminal may ask you for your username and password on Github so be prepared to type it in if it prompts you
Note: When you type in your password, you wont be able to see what your typing, so make sure you accurately type in your password for your github account the first time.
You're finished! These are the steps which I took to fork and clone using git hub and git on my terminal application.

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?

Did you learn any new skills or tricks? I learnt how to use the clone command and fork a repo on github. One trick I learnt was the command git checkout -b This switches to a new branch with a new name, as opposed to creating a new branch and switching to it from the master.

How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies? I'm feeling somewhat confident with my learning competencies. The only thing I got muddled the pull, merge, branch challenge, number 6 of the tech section in Sprint 1.

Which parts of the work did you enjoy? I really enjoy learning things by watching the video tutorials, so that's probably my favourite part. And discovering new commands for the terminal application. I also enjoy following step by step ways of getting a task done for github or on the terminal.

Which parts of the work did you find tedious? Watching tutorial videos, but at the same time I enjoy it.

Remote, Fork, Merge - Reflection

What is the difference between cloning from a forked and cloning from a non-forked repo. When you clone from a forked repo, it's not the original project. A non-forked repo you can not add changes as it's a read only version of that project.
Can you think of an analogy to describe forking? Forking is making a copy of a repository. They allow you to copy another project and make any changes that you want without affecting the original project. An analogy for forking would be taking a cracker from someone elses lunch box, drawing a moustache on it and showing the person who you stole the cracker from or just keeping it as souvenir and continuously drawing on that cracker until you are satisfied.
What is a remote? A remote are versions of your project that are hosted on the internet or a network somewhere.
Did anything surprise you? I was surprised to learn what remotes where and how to connect them.
Setting Remotes and Syncing Forks - Reflection

What is a remote? A remote is a place where you can save versions of your work. It enables you to save the work locally on your computer from a server, edit it and push your edited version from your computer back to the server,with the original project.
How are they set up? Firstly, you have to check and see what remotes you already have. To do this type git remote -v. This will show all your remotes. Now that you can see all your remotes, you can decide whether to delete any. If you're satisfied with your remotes and don't need to add any, this step is not necessary. To add a remote type git remote add Then type git remote -v and then you will see that your new remote has been added.
How would you explain a remote to a non-technical person using an analogy? A remote is a place where you have your files stored on a server. It's a remote place where you can access files.
Blog Challenge - Reflection

What did you learn about your learning? I learnt that it takes practice, practice, practice when it comes to learning coding. You have to be attentive and take your time with the learning.

What surprised you? What surprised me is how much I learnt in just a week. I have learn various codes, commands and definitions surround ggitit and github. I have learnt so much and it's been a surprise that I can learn and retain the information.

Think like a Programmer - Reflection

Describe the process for solving problems Take a breather and try to debug the problem. Reassess and look at what you may have done wrong, research solutions online to find someone who has already solved the problem and careat.
How will you integrate this idea? I will integrate this idea into my studies by trying out the steps and seeing if they simplify the process to resolving coding problems.
What did you learn about flipped classroom? A flipped classroom is not the tradition classroom where you sit in class and listen to a teacher speaking for long periods of time. It is usually online based learning where the student can watch tutorials and has access to resources where they can stop and start and go back to learning when they feel like it. The student has the ability to learn at their own pace and go back to any information they don't understand, until they get the concept. Flipped classroom is an outside of the class learning experience where you learn things before you initially work with a teacher. It's a prep/primer class usually web-based before you go into the physical classroom and learn from your teacher.
Introduce yourself. Know your Cohort - Reflection

What struck you about the the sharing practice on slack? Any surprises? Fears? Wonderful moments? I didn't have any fears, surprised or wonderful moments to be completely honest.
In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
