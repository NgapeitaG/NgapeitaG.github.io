As if talking to a Non-technical friend, discuss:

An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS:
<p>HTML is a document with text which consists of paragraphs, images, tables etc</p>
<p>A css however adds colour, font, borders, shadows and so much more to your HTML once you add a link to the CSS from the HTML.</p>
Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
