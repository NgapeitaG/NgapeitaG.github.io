# Discuss

As if talking to a Non-technical friend, discuss:

1. An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS:
<p>HTML is a document with text which consists of paragraphs, images, tables etc</p>
<p>A css however adds colour, font, borders, shadows and so much more to your HTML once you add a link to the CSS from the HTML.</p>

2. Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
<p>Control flow are a number of control statements which let you specify a certain order of execution. For example, in order to 
brush your teeth you obviously need a toothbrush and toothpaste to brush your teeth. There are a number of steps to follow to 
brush your teeth. The same goes for control flow. It follows statements so in our example, squeeze a certain amount of toothpaste 
on your toothbrush, wet your mouth and begin to brush your teeth. You will use make, if, for switch, while, and loops for control flow
statements. These statements ensure your steps are done in a certain order, so that the work is executed.</p>
 
 <p>Loops are when you can repeat sections of a code without 
 having to put in much effort. It's a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. Suppose you have a fat cat and you don't like 
feeding it because you feel like you're constantly feeding the cat because it eats too much. To solve this problem, you'd get an
automatic cat feeder which has the ability to feed your cat over and over a certain amount of times, say 4 times. The same goes with loop.
you can use a loop statement to repeat something so that it saves you having to type the statement four times. Instead, the statement does
it for you and repeats a certain amount of times, like the cat feeder did in our example.</p>

3. Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
<p>The DOM is basically what ties your HTML, CSS an JavaScript together. Your DOM is an object representation of your entire HTML document.

        * Everything that makes up a DOM is called ‘nodes’.
        
        * Nodes can be elements, attributes, text content, comments, document-related stuff, and various other things you simply never think about. 
        
        * When you open your web browser, you see a collision of HTML, CSS and Javascript working together to create whats shown. The DOM is a hierarchal structure that allows your browser to make sense of what is going on. 
        
        * The DOM is the missing link which ties your HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        
        * DOM: is the browsers internal programmable representation of the webpage. Can be manipulated by languages like JS, changing the page without changing HTML.
        </p>

        4. Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.

    * Arrays are a list of items. When you access data in arrays, you are basically looking at a list. This could be 1,2,3,4 or item 1, item 2, 
    item 3, item 4. 
    * A Java object is a combination of data and procedures working on the available data. An object has a state and behavior. The state of an 
    object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior. Objects are created from templates known as classes. 

5. Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
<p>A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. They are useful because they perform a task when you call to use it. A function can be used in an object so that specified task is performed every time without you having to re-type that task.</p>
