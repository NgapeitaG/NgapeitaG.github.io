<h1>What surprised me the most about learning core is</h1>
<p>That I had to look at my mindset and how I was thinking. I think it was interesting that we had to look at our strengths, our weaknesses, our values, personality traits and our learning style. If we hadn’t of gone through these Core tasks, then we would just be learning content but not actually dissecting how our brain retains that information. Learning core has taught me many things about myself and has made me ask questions about how I’m going to study at Dev Academy and do it successfully. There’s no point in learning something new if you’re not learning something new about yourself or constantly accessing where you need to do better. </p>
