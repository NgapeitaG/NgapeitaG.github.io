<h6>Reflection</h6>
<h2>Utilising your journal findings and the high level overview of the Core learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer the following questions:</h2>
<h1>Questions</h1>
<p><ol><li>Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey.</li><br><li>What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?</li><br><li>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</li><br><li>What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li><br><li>Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?</li></ol></p>
<h1>Answers</h1>
<p><ol><li>It has helped me tremendously by working out how I am going to learn during bootcamp, it has given me ideas and tools to look at any mindsets which I may be stuck in and need to change, but also it has helped me research how my brain works and how I will successfully complete this course with Dev Academy.</li><br><li>I've learnt that I'm a productive worker, I like everything to be organized in my life and I'm very analytical. I learn through interacting with learning material as well as some visual and audial. I also learnt that I need to work on my emotional intelligence a lot more.</li><br><li>Learning about neuroplasticity. I found this subject to be very interesting. Just the idea of having the ability to change your IQ and make your mind a more efficient organ is truely amazing. If we simple change old habits, read books and do things to broaden our minds, then this is where the rules of neuroplasticity apply</li><li>I think having to look at my strengths, weaknesses and values. I interviewed two family members as part of my core learning and some of what they said about me contradicted some of the beliefs I had about myself. Sometimes we don't like to admit it but we all have weaknessed which we have to identify and work on. This was probably the only minor challenging aspect for me of the core learning.</li><br><li>I really enjoyed doing the looping challenge where we had to partner with someone in our cohort and listen to them for two minutes, then loop back what they said. During foundations, we all had to be very self-sufficient and work alone. I look forward to working with people in my cohort during bootcamp because it's always good to collaborate with and have a meeting of minds when it comes to difficult problems.</li></ol></p>
