	<h1>Learning plan</h1>
		<br>
       <strong> My strengths are that:</strong><br><br>
•	I work very hard and possess a great deal of stamina. I take immense satisfaction in being busy and productive.<br>
•	I look to the future and what possibilities there are.<br>
•	I enjoy close relationships with others. I find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.<br>
•	I enjoy routine and structure. My world is best described by the order I create. I like my life to be neat and tidy in other words.<br>
•	I take psychological ownership of what I say I will do. I’m committed to stable values such as honesty and loyalty.<br><br>

<strong>My Limitations are that:</strong><br><br>
•	I like consistency and crave stable routines and clear rules and procedures that everyone can follow.<br>
•	I can procrastinate sometimes and often get easily distracted, but when I’m really into something, I will commit to the task.<br>
•	Sometimes I’m not good at putting my thoughts into words at first. <br>
•	I need to be a more analytical person and really study a problem to figure out the solution.<br><br>

<strong>To manage my workload, I will:</strong><br><br>
•	commit my time<br>
•	Work very hard<br>
•	Have a positive and motivated attitude towards any tasks which are given to me<br>
•	Don’t leave tasks to the last minute<br>
•	Break my project into sub-tasks to make the one project more easier to complete in steps<br>
•	Not to waste time on watching youtube<br><br>
In order to work productively with other students and the facilitators, the best things which I can use are my communication skills (asking questions), time management skills, initiative, hard-work ethic and to build a healthy rapport with my classmates. I think the most important relationship which I will have to form is with my classmates most of all because we’ll be seeing each other every day for the ‘Bootcamp”. I want to work collaboratively with both my fellow classmates and facilitators. I will be committed to the workload, share my thoughts and idea’s, turn up to any lessons on time, put one hundred percent effort into all projects and give off good vibes in the class to create a productive work space. I want to contribute in a positive way to not only the work I produce but the work space in which I’ll be inhabiting.<br><br>
To seek help I have the options of emailing my facilitator, asking my classmates on Slack or googling the answer. Google and Slack will be my best friends when it comes to seeking help. If those solutions prove to be difficult, I will have to email a facilitator but I will do all these three approaches at once and see which one works until I get the answer, before time runs out.<br><br>
I only expect any technical answers which I require to be answered by the facilitation team, but also a support network if I have an queries.<br><br>
Thursdays and Fridays I’m expected to work during the night but I only work casually. If I can’t manage working and studying, I can put my full attention on my studies with Dev Academy. I’m also committed to a church group which I attend. I have not attended but I may be returning to my church group every Tuesday nights from 7PM – 8:30PM. I may also postpone this for next year, until I’ve completed my studies with Dev Academy.<br><br>
I am prepared to be fully committed to Dev Academy and will do anything necessary to successfully complete the course.
