<h6> Emotion Intelligence blog</h6>

<h2>The mind is a deep thing which is yet to be explored.</h2><h1> It is an amazing organ connected to the nervous system
and is responsible for controlling our feelings and thoughts. In this blog, I am going to be explaining just what 
emotional intelligence is and how it differs to IQ.</h1>

<h2>Emotional intelligence:</h2>
<h1>Emotional intelligence is having the ability to be mindful and attentive to your emotions and the emotions of others.
It's the art of mastering your emotions, how you relate to other people and social communication. If you have
poor emotional intelligence, it's difficult for you to be a master of your emotions and communicate.</h1>

<h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
<h1>IQ is when you're using your brain to solve problems and it's your knowledge and thinking base.
EQ relates to your emotions where as IQ relates to your intelligence and where you're using knowledge in your brain
not emotions or social skills.</h1>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<h1>Emotional intelligence is important because it tells your brain how to react to different situations.
Its the hub which tells you how to communicate and socialise with other humans. Emotional intelligence is important because
it's used when we interact with the outside world and how in touch with our feelings we are. We have to be aware of our emotional
intelligence because we use this when we are with other people. It's used to form bonds. Basically, it's our people skills and how we
react emotionally. </h1>
