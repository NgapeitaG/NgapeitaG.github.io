	When I was learning the basics of Javascript with a website called Free Code Camp, I was stuck with a few issues which I had to solve. Free code camp is basically a website which gives you tutorials which you must follow and then you have to complete specific steps, so that you can learn how to use Javascript. One of the many challenges I had difficulty with whilst working through the FreeCodeCamp tutorials was using escape sequences in strings. I had a block when I didn't know where to put certain escape characters.

	To solve this problem, I followed the steps, carefully wrote out the code and went over it and ran the code. When the code didn't work constantly, I stopped, told myself that this is a simple problem which isn't difficult, I started over, re-typed my code and cracked the problem and found my solution. As long as you believe that you can solve a difficult problem and try again, you will get the answer. Breaking the problem down into smaller tasks and looking at each of those elements will help you look at the problem in smaller steps, so that you can successfully resolve your errors. Through out the process I felt frustrated sometimes but when I begin to feel like that, I take a breather, walk away from the computer to clear my mind and come back to the problem, only if I'm feeling stressed. Once I do resolve a coding error however, I feel like I'm achieving little by little.

	In this particular situation where I had to write the proper code using escape sequences, I learned that I can code and if I read between the lines, I'll figure out the solutions for various coding problems. It turns out variables are case sensitive, spacing is important so having no spacing in this case was required and how you type the text is just as important. In order for code to work correctly as a web developer/coder, you have to make sure that code whic you're writing out is formatted correctly. It's important that you type your text in correctly, otherwise it won't work, leaving you with errors which you have to fix along thr way.

	Here is the problem which I had to write out:
	FirstLinenewlinetabbackslashSecondLinenewlineThirdLine<br>
	
	Here is the solution I resolved:
	var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"<br><br>
	
	This may seem like a simple problem to resolve but what I was doing was over-thinking a simple solution and typing in the wrong solution. Don't over-think your code and look at how you're typing it.

	I feel pretty confident using the pseudocode method as it's more ordered and straight-forward. When using the 'trying something' method, it depends as it may or may not work. I've not tried the rubber ducky method but will give it a try in the future. I'd feel confident using the rubber ducky method. I didn't felt confident using the reading errors method as it only told me what was wrong and I could get a sense of what the error was, but it didn't necessarily tell me how to solve the problem. Sometimes, I felt that the error messages didn't make any sense at times. In regards to console logging, I didn't use this method during problem solving, so I guess it's safe to say I'm not in favour of using console logging unless I have to during problem solving. Googling is very helpful and has was the main reason why I have successfully completed some tasks. I feel very confident using google to help me solve problems. I also feel very confident when asking my coaches as peers for help as they always give a helping hand and clarify steps and tasks to me. Lastly, the 'improving your process with reflection' method is similar to 'trying something' in my eyes. When something would be wrong in my code, I would look at how I'm writing my process and improve it by reflection. This is probably the best method which I feel most comfortable using during problem solving.
