	When I was learning the basics of Javascript with a website called Free Code Camp, I was stuck with a few issues which I had to solve. Free code camp is basically a website which gives you tutorials which you must follow and then you have to complete specific steps, so that you can learn how to use Javascript. One of the many challenges I had difficulty with whilst working through the FreeCodeCamp tutorials was using escape sequences in strings. I had a block when I didn't know where to put certain escape characters.

	To solve this problem, I followed the steps, carefully wrote out the code and went over it and ran the code. When the code didn't work constantly, I stopped, told myself that this is a simple problem which isn't difficult, I started over, re-typed my code and cracked the problem and found my solution. As long as you believe that you can solve a difficult problem and try again, you will get the answer!
