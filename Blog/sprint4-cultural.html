	<h2>
		Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
	</h2>
	<h1>
		When people understand the basic principles of neuroplasticity, they change the way their brain is wired and allow their brains the ability to grow. Neuroplasticity is around the growth of the brain. When we have what we call a ‘fixed mindset’, we simply give up so to speak and don’t try to open our minds. When you apply the principles of neuroplasticity, we have the ability to modify our brains connections so that we can rewire it to think in a different way. We are essentially expanding our minds and changing the way we think. One principle of neuroplasticity is going over something new which you’ve learnt repeatedly. The more you practice something, the stronger the connections will be in your brain, ensuring that you retain that information for the future.

	<h2>
		Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplaticity for your own benefit?
	</h2>
	<h1>
		To engage with the neuroplasticity principals, here are a few which I would like to practice more for my own benefit:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Repetition
			</li>
			<li>
				Transference
			</li>
			<li>
				Intensity
			</li>
			<li>
				And use it and improve it
			</li>
		</ul>
		To engage with the principal of repetition, I would like to repeat tutorials and go over principals relating either to Javascript, CSS or HTML so that I can solidly retain that information. Transference can be applied when I’ve learnt something in Javascript and can use it to develop my skills in another area relating to what I’ve just learnt. Intensity is also important because you’re taking what you’re learning more seriously when things are done in a timely fashion. Using and improving it means that once I’ve learnt something, I improve on it and get better on what I’ve learnt. I believe that I will benefit from these principals immensely and if I apply them, I will definitely improve in the way I learn and work.

		Research Growth Mindset
	</h6>
	<h2>
		Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
	</h2>
	<h1>
		A growth mindset is wiring your brain to solve difficult problems, learn new things and essentially to think growth. It is very relevant because we as a society have wired ourselves to have to be rewarded in order to submit and work for something. We are addicted to instant gratification and like to be praised for our accomplishments. A growth mindset will increase your intelligence, how much you learn and how you allow your mind to expand. You move out of a fixed mindset and turn your brain into a brain which wants to learn and try new things. This is a growth mindset. A mindset where you utilize your brains capabilities and set it into growth mode.
	</h1>
	<h2>
		In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
	</h2>
	<h1>
		I have learned a great deal about how I can change habits. I feel like this was a refreshing experience and it feels like I’m not utilising my brain capabilities fully. I am still young and I want to learn these skills so that I can have a properly functioning brain.
	</h1>
	<h2>
		How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
	</h2>
	<h1>
		A growth mindset believes in expanding itself. It believes in the not yet seen. In the possibilities, not the now. I want to imagine myself as a coder and use that as my key motivator to push me to better myself and grow. I want to retain all the information as I’m studying. A growth mindset will be a healthy, ‘I can’ mindset. A growth mindset does not limit itself, it believes in itself, it is a healthy and stable place which takes growth and change. Yes, your brain may feel sore from learning but If you change your old ways of thinking, you can learn something new and also about yourself. This mindset of change and positivity is what I want to integrate into my learning journey.

	<h1>
		I would very much like to incorporate the new found information which I just learnt in this segment. I definitely would like to have a growth mindset where I know that my abilities are not limited, I want to practice hard tasks more, change old habits and patterns with new ones, challenge my brain, no procrastinate, meditate and take care of my mind and body. After learning about these different concepts and principals around the brain, I will be very much influenced by these different approaches to expanding and growing my mind. I love learning new things every day and want to have a more regular routine of study and have a new mindset when I go into bootcamp.
