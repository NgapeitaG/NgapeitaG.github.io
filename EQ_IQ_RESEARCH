What is Emotional Intelligence?
Emotional intelligence is having the ability to be mindful and attentive. 
It's the art of mastering your emotions and your thoughts. If you have a clogged 
brain, you cannot properly function. 

How is it different to IQ?
IQ is when you're using your brain to solve problems and it's your knowledge and thinking base.
This is different to EQ because EQ relates to your personal thoughts where your mind
could be wandering. EQ relates to your emotions where as IQ relates to your intelligence and where you're using knowledge in your brain
not emotions.

Why is it important?
Emotional intelligence is important because it tells your brain how to react to different situations.
Its the hub which tells you how to communicate and socialise with other humans. Emotional intelligence is important because
it's used when we interact with the outside world and how in touch with our thoughts and emotions we are.
