Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h6><h1>So I had to burn a bridge and cut off a close friend of mine. We had been forming a friendship over a span of one year and we seemed to get along fine. Out of the blue, my friend began to act funny to me and whenever I'd see here, she'd ignore me when I'd say hello and not want to look at me. I was unsure of what I had done to deserve this treatment and thought that she was a loyal and decent person. We were always seen together at events and always made the effort to make our friendship known, but down the track things started to get sour.When I started to notice her ignoring me and trying to not look at me, my instinct was to talk things out but she'd deny anything was wrong. We began to compete against eachother and act in foolish ways towards eachother. Finally, I decided to cut the friend off and block her out of my life altogether. The consequence of cutting my friend off was her spreading rumours about me, competing with me and turning sour for no given reason on me. Sometimes the decent thing to do is cut unhealthy relationships out of your life, no matter who the person is. You have to keep your mental, emotional and physical well – being in excellent condition. </h1><h6>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h6><h1>My culture has shaped my values through how I was raised. I was traditionally brought up to follow Maori tikanga and protocols. I believe that everyone needs to be treated equally and this shapes how I interact with people from different ethnic backgrounds. Whether you’re European, Indian, Asian, African; we should all be treated with the same human rights and respect. I believe in helping the less fortunate. Many Maori make up a large majority of the prison populations, we have low success rates in education and employment, as well as Pacific islanders. Being Pacific island (Samoan) and Maori myself, this has given me a deep aspiration to help others. Empathy and kindness are a big part of my values. My mother and father are both hardworking people and believe in independence and hardwork. This is another contributor to my core values of hardwork and drive.</h1><h6>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h6><h1>When I have to be, I will be outspoken. One time, I was at work doing a five hour shift. I do a waitressing job so it can be stressful at times. On this particular night it was very busy and we had many customers coming through. I was beginning to get stressed and tired. The supervisor that day advised me that I can stop waitressing and that I can just wipe down the bar area and do some small jobs before my shift ended. As my shift was coming to an end and I was about to go home, the bartender girl asked me to do a simple job for her. I thought, okay that’s easy, I’ll do the job for her and then I’ll go home, but then she started saying that I didn’t know anything and kept demanding me to do more and more tasks which she was meant to do but she was not explaining just what she was wanting me to do for her. She started to yell across the bar at me in front in customers and I had to speak up to her in an authoritative voice and say to her “you’re not explaining just want you’re wanting me to do”. She looked stunned and she took up fifteen minutes of my time before I was finished for my shift. The values which I used in this situation was to be outspoken. I told the supervisor of what happened and just clarified what happened. The consequence of that was that customers heard me raise my voice at another employee in front of them but it was clarified in the end and the other employee was actually just lazy and not explaining herself clearly. </h1><h6>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h6><h1>Maori are at the bottom of the demographics in New Zealand. This fact has driven me to want to do well for myself and succeed in life. I don’t like seeing or hearing that Maori are at the bottom of everything. I want to leave a legacy and continue a culture of success in my own family. 
Another way that my culture has influenced my values is support. I love to be hospitable and help people. This is a basic principle which Maori apply in Tikanga. I believe that the strength of our culture has influenced me. Maori people and sometimes Maori women can be strong minded. I have been known to be outspoken at times. 
</h1><h6>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h6><h1>My strengths in learning I notice is working hard and consistency. A weakness however is procrastination sometimes.
Strengths career wise is working hard, working to a deadline and problem solving. I’m currently studying towards a career so I’ve not discovered many weaknesses yet. As I develop in my career, I would like to develop my relationship building skills, communication skills, time management and self-care.
</h1><h6>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h6><h1>I am a very consistent and proactive learner. These are key attributes which will be very useful in my learning journey. I am also a very articulate person that is good at problem solving. These will also compliment my learning journey along the way.</h1><h6>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h6><h1>At Whitecliffe College, I had to work with two of my friends, they were both Chinese. We had to complete a graphics assignment together of where we had to create a Utopia and Dystopia world using animated graphics, gifs etc. One friend however wanted to do all the work and me and my other friend not do any work, but just run with her ideas. The other friend agreed with this idea. Also, they were not inclusive of me in the project and only worked amongst eachother, excluding all the idea’s and graphics I wanted to contribute. Long story short, I had an argument with the friend who was agreeing with everything and didn’t bother as my suggestions were hushed in the project. The strategies I used was not effective. Communication your feelings are important when working in a team. If you feel like your team mates are disregarding your ideas, let them know, don’t get really angry and walk off or give up on the team. Honesty is key.</h1>
